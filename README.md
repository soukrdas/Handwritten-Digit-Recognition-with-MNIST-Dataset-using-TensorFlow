# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-MNIST-Dataset-using-TensorFlow
This project builds a neural network model with TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It trains on thousands of images to learn patterns and then predicts the digit in a new image with good accuracy. This is a great beginner project for learning about image classification and deep learning!
